Main codes are provided for the linear IV model and the real data analysis in the main paper, and the nonlinear model in the supplementary file:

1. File 'real_data' includes the real data set used  and the required R codes.

2. File 'sim_linearIV_model' includes R codes for the linear IV model used in the simulation of the main paper.

3. File 'sim_nonlinear_model' includes R codes for the dynamic panel data model in the supplementary file.

Each R script is commented on the top of the file. 

Some results use similar codes, and we now provide a typical version. More details or any question, please email to zhangjia@swufe.edu.cn.
